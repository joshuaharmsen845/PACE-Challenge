May 2021

Challenge Description: https://pacechallenge.org/2021/

A nuanced approach to cluster editing which utilizes existing cliques in the
formation of "complete" clusters by considering whether to add or cut
a vertex from the cluster piece-wise.

Instalation can be done by running the makefile with "make" and the program can 
be executed with "./pace < graphfile.gr"
